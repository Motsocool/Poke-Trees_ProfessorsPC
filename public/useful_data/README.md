# Reference Data for Save File Parsing

This directory contains reference data files for accurate parsing of Gen 1, 2, and 3 Pokémon save files.

## Directory Structure

- **Gen1/**: Reference data for Generation 1 games (Red/Blue/Yellow)
- **Gen2/**: Reference data for Generation 2 games (Gold/Silver/Crystal)  
- **Gen3/**: Reference data for Generation 3 games (Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald/FireRed/LeafGreen)
